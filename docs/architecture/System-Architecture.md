# Campus Atlas System Architecture

## Current Prototype

The current prototype contains:

- React frontend
- Express API
- Mock platform data for modules, metrics, student profile, services, AI use cases, experiments, evaluation, governance, and launch plan
- Product documentation for PRD, personas, metrics, AI strategy, experiments, GTM, and architecture

## Future-State Architecture

```

## AI Copilot Future Design

The AI copilot should use:

- Retrieval augmented generation
- Campus knowledge base
- Policy documents
- Academic calendar
- Course catalog
- Service workflow data
- Guardrails and escalation logic

## AI System Design

Student Question
      |
      v
Intent + Risk Classifier
      |
      +--> High-risk request -> Human handoff
      |
      v
Retrieval Layer
      |
      +--> Campus policies
      +--> Registrar FAQs
      +--> Library and service workflows
      +--> Student context with role-based access
      |
      v
LLM Response Generator
      |
      v
Grounding + Citation Check
      |
      +--> Low confidence -> Clarify or escalate
      |
      v
Workflow Action
      |
      +--> Create ticket
      +--> Renew item
      +--> Request document
      +--> Verify credential
```

## Evaluation And Monitoring Architecture

```text
Prompt + Retrieved Sources + Response + User Outcome
      |
      v
Trace Store
      |
      +--> Offline eval set
      +--> Groundedness checks
      +--> Escalation review
      +--> Safety review
      +--> Cohort fairness monitoring
      |
      v
Quality Dashboard
      |
      +--> PM backlog
      +--> Policy updates
      +--> Model/prompt changes
      +--> Human operations training
```

## Service Boundaries

| Service | Responsibility | PM-owned success signal |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Student profile, roles, access, credentials | Verification time saved |
| Campus Services | Library, dining, transport, help desk workflows | Completed service workflows |
| AI Copilot | RAG answers, routing, workflow suggestions | Verified self-service resolution |
| Analytics | Adoption, operations, bottlenecks | Weekly dashboard-active admins |
| Evaluation | Quality gates, trace review, safety monitoring | Groundedness and escalation precision |

## Integration Roadmap

1. Student information system for profile and enrollment data
2. LMS for courses, assignments, and academic calendar context
3. Library system for catalog and due-date workflows
4. Payment provider for dining, dues, and service marketplace flows
5. SSO provider for secure university login
6. Data warehouse for admin analytics and longitudinal product metrics

## Security Principles

- Role-based access control
- Student data privacy
- Audit logs
- Secure authentication
- Data minimization
- FERPA-aligned design principles for US higher education context
- Human escalation for high-impact decisions
- AI trace review with PII minimization
- Access-scoped retrieval for student-specific context
